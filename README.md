# Robotics
Please follow these steps when beginning a project. 
Since we are all working together on one repo, it can cause some major problems.
Make sure that you follow ALL of these steps, or you could ruin everything.
## Setup
The first thing you are going to do is create a <i>branch</i>.
* Go to the top of the files apove. It should have something that says "# branches". Click it.
* Press the big green button that says "New Branch"
* The Branch name should be your first name only (Capital First, like Anthony). Set source to main

Next, you will need to create a codespace using that branch.
* At the top of the page, press the + button, and click "New codespace".
  * The Repo is Scecina-STEM/Robotics
  * Make sure that the branch is the one that you created.

Creating that should open up a tab with the code editor.
* Once you are in, you need to run a command to create a folder for yourself.
* Go to the terminal and type in the following code (replacing words in brackets as needed)

```
mkdir [your name (lowercase)]
```

```
EXAMPLE
mkdir anthony
```

* This is the ONLY place that you should be writing your code. Each user will have their own, so that when we merge them together, everyone's code is sperate.
* IF YOU DON'T, then we'll have really big problems when we merge the codes.
* LASTLY: MAKE SURE YOU ARE ALWAYS USING YOUR BRANCH. If you use someone else's, then you can cause a headache to fix.
  * You can tell which branch you are on by the name in the bottom left.
