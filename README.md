# Robotics
Please follow these steps when beginning a project. 
Since we are all working together on one repo, it can cause some major problems.
Make sure that you follow ALL of these steps, or you could ruin everything.
## Setup
You will need to create a codespace using the main branch.
* At the top of the page, press the + button, and click "New codespace".
  * The Repo is Scecina-STEM/Robotics
  * Make sure that the branch is "main"

Creating that should open up a tab with the code editor.
* Once you are in, you need to run a command to create a folder for yourself.
* Go to the terminal and type in the following code (replacing words in brackets as needed)

```
mkdir [your name (lowercase)]
```

```
EXAMPLE
mkdir anthony
```

* This is the ONLY place that you should be writing your code. Each user will have their own, so that when we merge them together, everyone's code is sperate.
* IF YOU DON'T, then we'll have really big problems when we merge the codes.
* DO NOT EDIT ANOTHER PERSON'S DIRECTORY (FOLDER)!
